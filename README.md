# Umbraco Backoffice Themes

**Additional themes for Umbraco backoffice.**

## Getting Started

### Idea

The idea is to create a feature for Umbraco Backoffice to enable editors to switch to different themes e.g. dark theme (inspired by various IDEs for developers). It might be worth to consider some other more accessible sets of themes e.g. high contrast one or just for fun - legacy (orange) theme or hacker theme.

The wider idea contains also ability to customize currently selected theme e.g. by changing some base colors or palletes.

Current "progress" (mostly for PoC / demo purposes) is visible here:

## Contributing to this project

Yes, please! Anyone and everyone is welcome to contribute.

We need someone with some design skills and good taste to help us pick the right color palletes and help in coding it to fit Umbraco's standards.
